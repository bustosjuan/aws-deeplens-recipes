Use AWS DeepLens and Amazon Rekognition to build an application that helps identify if a person at a construction site is wearing the right safety gear, in this case, a hard hat. 

## Learning objectives
In this lab you will learn the following:
- Create and deploy an object detection project to AWS DeepLens.
- Modify the AWS DeepLens object detection inference Lambda function to detect persons and upload the frame to Amazon S3.
- Create a Lambda function to identify persons who are not wearing safety hats.
- Analyze the results using AWS IoT , Amazon CloudWatch and a web dashboard.
