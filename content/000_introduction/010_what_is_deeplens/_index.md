## The world's first deep learning enabled video camera for developers

AWS DeepLens helps put machine learning in the hands of developers, literally, with a fully programmable video camera, tutorials, code, and pre-trained models designed to expand deep learning skills.

The new AWS DeepLens (2019 Edition) is available to purchase in the US and in seven new countries: UK, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Canada, and Japan. We have improved the hardware and software to make the device even easier to setup, allowing you to get started with machine learning more quickly.
